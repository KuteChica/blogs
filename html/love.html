    <h1>Uncoditional Love</h1>
    <p class="content">Lena’s world revolved around Max. She loved him with every fiber of her being, and he’d become her entire universe. She’d do anything for him, sacrificing her needs and desires without a second thought. Her friends and family would often tell her,

“Lena, you need to take care of yourself too,”

But she’d just smile and say,

“I’m happy when he’s happy.”

As time passed, Lena’s love for Max only grew stronger. She’d cook his favorite meals, attend every event he wanted her to, and support him through thick and thin. But in her quest to make him happy, she forgot to prioritize her own happiness. She’d ignore her own dreams, suppress her own feelings, and compromise her own values to fit into Max’s world.

Max, however, didn’t appreciate Lena’s sacrifices. He took her love for granted, exploiting her kindness and generosity. He’d belittle her, make her feel small, and disregard her feelings. Lena, blinded by her love, would brush it off, thinking that Max would eventually change.

But the day came when Max’s words cut too deep. He said something that shattered Lena’s heart into a million pieces. She realized that she’d lost herself in her love for him, and that she’d been living in a toxic relationship.

The breakup was messy, and Lena’s world came crashing down. She felt lost, broken, and heartbroken. For weeks, she struggled to get out of bed, to eat, or to find meaning in anything. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Lena began to heal.

She started by taking small steps. She began journaling, practicing yoga, and reconnecting, with old friends. She discovered new hobbies, like painting and writing, which brought her joy and peace. Slowly, Lena learned to love herself, to prioritize her own needs, and to recognize her own worth.

One day, while journaling, Lena wrote:

“I forgot to love myself because I was so busy loving him. But now, I realize that self-love is not selfish; it’s essential.”

This realization marked a turning point in her journey.

Lena emerged from the heartbreak stronger, wiser, and more compassionate. She learned that true love begins with self-love and that she deserved to be loved and respected by herself and others. She realized that she didn’t need anyone else to complete her; she was whole just as she was.

As Lena looked in the mirror, she smiled, feeling a sense of pride and self-worth.

She knew that she’d never forget the lessons she’d learned from her experience with Max. She’d carry them with her, using them to build a stronger, more loving relationship- with herself.
