    <h1>Everyone thinks they knew her</h1>
    <p class="content">
Esther smiled brightly as she walked through the crowded hallway, exchanging effortless hellos with classmates and teachers alike. But as she turned the corner, her gaze caught on a faded photograph taped to the inside of her locker door. A girl with haunted eyes stared back at her, a girl who looked nothing like the confident, popular Esther everyone thought they knew.

Esther‚Äôs smile faltered for a moment, and she felt a familiar knot from in her stomach. She quickly covered it up with a laugh, waving at she turned back to the photograph, her eyes lingered on the girl with the haunted eyes. That girl was the real Esther, the one she kept hidden behind a mask of perfection and charm

As she gazed at the photograph, memories began to flood back the late-night crying jage, the whispered promises to herself that things would get better, the desperate attempts to fit in and be loved. Esther‚Äôs thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her locker door being yanked open. Her best friend, Rachel, was rummaging through her books, chatting about the upcoming party.

Esther forced a smile, pushing the memories back into the shadows she didn‚Äôt want Rachel to see the real her, the one who was still broken and scared. Not yet, anyway.

As the days passed, Esther found it increasingly difficult to keep up the act. The weight of her secrets was suffocating her, and she felt like she was living a lie. One person, however, seemed to sense that something was off. A quiet, observant classmate named Alex had been watching Esther from afar, noticing the cracks in her facade.

One afternoon, Alex approached Esther after class, and their eyes locked in a moment of unexpected understanding.

‚ÄúHey, Esther, can I talk to you for a minute?

Alex asked, their voice gentle.

Esther‚Äôs instincts screamed at her to flee, but something about Alex‚Äôs kind eyes made her hesitate

‚ÄúSure, What‚Äôs up?

She replied, trying to sound casual. Alex leaned against the desk, their voice barely above a whisper

‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed you seem‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ different sometimes like there‚Äôs more to you than what everyone sees ‚Äú.

Esther‚Äôs heart skipped a beat as she met Alex‚Äôs gaze. For the first time in a long while, she felt seen. Without thinking. Esther opened up to Alex, sharing fragments of her past and the masks she wore. As she spoke, a weight lifted off her shoulders and she felt a sense of liberation wash over her. Alex listened attentively, their expression empathetic, and for the first time, Esther felt like she might not be alone.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Esther realized she had found someone who understood her, someone who saw the real her. And in that moment, she knew she‚Äôd finally found a chance to be free from the secrets that had haunted her for so long.
