    <p>Dorcas’ eyes, once bright with hope, now held a depth of pain that seemed to swallow her whole.The memories of her husband’s fists, the words that cut deeper than any blade, and the final blow of his departure still lingered left alone, pregnant, and vulnerable, she clung to the fragile thread of hope, determined to give her unborn child a better life.

As the contractions intensified, Dorcas’s grip on the hospital bed tightened. She had been in labor for hours, but the medical staff seemed to be in on hurry to attend to her. She called out for help. Her voice was hoarse from crying and pleading, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears.

The hospital was overcrowded and under-resourced, and Dorcas was just another statistic in a long line of women struggling to access basic healthcare. She thought of her husband who had abandoned her when she needed him most, and the tears pricked at the corners of her eyes.

Just as she thought she couldn’t bear the pain anymore, a kind-faced nurse slipped into the room. I’m so sorry, Dorcas, she whispered, I’ll do what I can to help you. But even the nurse’s kindness was tempered by the harsh reality of the hospital’s limitations.

Dorcas’s eyes scanned the room, desperate for any sign of hope. That’s when she saw the water cooler in the corner, labeled “Not for Drinking” in faded letters. Desperate and dehydrated, she stumbled out of bed and made her way to the cooler, cupping her hands to catch the lukewarm water.

As Dorcas drank from the water cooler, she felt a mix of desperation and resignation wash over her. The water tasted bitter, and she wondered if it was even safe to drink. But she had no choice. The nurse returned with a sympathetic smile and a few strips of gauze.

With a deep breath, Dorcas pushed through the pain, her body trembling with exhaustion. The nurse coached her through each contraction, urging her to bear down. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a tiny cry filled the room.

Dorcas’s eyes welled up with tears as she held her newborn daughter close for a moment, the struggles, the pain, and the uncertainty faded away. All that mattered was this small, precious life she had brought into the world.

As the nurse wrapped the baby in a worn blanket, I would do everything to give you a better life, my child. I promise. In that moment, she found a glimmer of hope, a determination to rise above the hardships and build a brighter future for herself and her daughter.

Even without family and husband</p>
